		What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository is basically what creates it. If you don't do it it wont be in the git directory so you wont be able to commit any files. It also creates a .gitfile inside your folder. This is basically what controls and monitors what you are doing with the repository.

		How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
		What value do you think it offers?
The working directory might not have been saved yet it is basically open and it is what you are working on. the repository is the whole thing it has been saved or added to and it might have a history. It also contains all the files and folders connected to what you are working on. Your working directory might just contain a couple of files that you are working on whereas the repository will contain everything connected.
